# opentok-titanium-mobile

A module for the Titanium Mobile platform that uses the Opentok iOS and Android SDKs for video streaming.

## Background Information

This module was originally created by Ankur Oberoi, a member of the Opentok team. He did all the hard work creating the iOS module, but he's been unable to maintain it over the last couple years, and his original work is very outdated and no longer works. This fork gets it working with the latest version of the Opentok iOS SDK, and also adds support for Android using the latest Android SDK.

The Android module is something I wrote when I was a fairly new developer, and while it works fine, it could probably stand to be refactored in some areas. I attempted to get its functionality as close to the iOS module as possible, but there are a couple areas where you'll need to make platform specific calls.

The iOS module is something I've just hacked together to work with the newer versions of Opentok and Titanium. I have zero Objective-C experience outside of tinkering with this, and I have no desire to learn it. As such, the iOS module is a bit of a mess, and could definitely stand to be refactored if anyone with more Objective-C experience wants to tackle it.

Since I actively maintain a Titanium application that uses this module, I will continue to update it as new versions of Titanium and Opentok call for it. But again, my main focus is just to keep it working at this point, not to make it a paragon of clean code and best practices. If anyone wants to actively contribute and improve upon it, please do.

## Installation

#### iOS

1. Download the latest [Opentok iOS SDK](https://tokbox.com/opentok/libraries/client/ios/) (2.10.0 as of this writing) and include `OpenTok.framework` in the root folder.
2. If you do not have Titanium SDK 5.5.1, open `titanium.xcconfig` and change 5.5.1 to the version you have.
3. Run `./build.py` from the terminal.
4. Extract the archive to your Titanium project's modules folder.
5. Add the module in your Titanium project's tiapp.xml file.

#### Android

1. Download the latest [Opentok Android SDK](https://tokbox.com/opentok/libraries/client/android/) (2.10.0 as of this writing). Rename the .aar file to .zip, extract it, rename classes.jar to opentok-android-sdk-2.10.0.jar. Create a libs and lib folder in your root directory. Move opentok-android-sdk-2.10.0.jar to the lib folder. Copy content from jni folder and libjingle_peerconnection_java.jar into libs folder.
2. Open `build.properties` and update the paths to wherever you have those things installed to. You may also need to change the Android SDK version, Titanium version, and Android NDK version, depending on what you have installed.
3. Run `ant` from the terminal.
4. Extract the archive to your Titanium project's modules folder.
5. Add the module in your Titanium project's tiapp.xml file.

## Basic Usage

```javascript

var opentok = require('com.tokbox.ti.opentok');
var sessionId;
var session;
var token;
var session;
var publisher;
var apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

function getSessionInfo() {
	// get session from your server
}

function createOpentokSession() {
	session = opentok.createSession({
		sessionId: sessionId,
		apiKey: apiKey
	});
	connectSession(session);
}

function disconnectOpentokSession() {
	if (session) {
		session.disconnect();
		session = null;
	}
}

function connectSession(opentokSession) {
	if (opentokFailed) return;
	session = opentokSession;
	if (session) {
		session.addEventListener('sessionConnected', sessionConnected);
		session.addEventListener('sessionDisconnected', sessionDisconnected);
		session.addEventListener('sessionFailed', sessionFailed);
		session.addEventListener('streamCreated', streamCreated);
		session.addEventListener('streamDestroyed', streamDestroyed);

		session.connect(apiKey, token);
	}
}

function sessionConnected() {
	if (Alloy.CFG.IOS) {
		Ti.Media.setAudioSessionCategory(Ti.Media.AUDIO_SESSION_CATEGORY_PLAY_AND_RECORD); // when done set back to Ti.Media.AUDIO_SESSION_CATEGORY_PLAYBACK
	}

	if (Ti.Platform.model != 'Simulator' && !publisherView) {
		publisher = session.publish();
		publisher.cameraPosition = 'cameraBack';
		publisherView = publisher.createView({
			width : Ti.UI.FILL,
			height : Ti.UI.FILL,
			center : 0
		});
		$.videoView.add(publisherView);
		if (Alloy.CFG.Android) {
			session.connectPublisher();
		}
	}
}

function sessionDisconnected() {
	alert('opentok disconnected');
}

function sessionFailed() {
	alert('The session failed. Please try again later.');
}

function streamDestroyed(e) {
	if (e && e.stream) {
		var stream = e.stream;
	}

	if (stream && session && stream.connection.connectionId != session.connection.connectionId) {
		if ($.videoView && subscriberView) {
			$.videoView.remove(subscriberView);
			subscriberView = null;
		}
	}
}

function streamCreated(e) {
	var stream = e.stream;
	if (stream.connection.connectionId === session.connection.connectionId) {
		return;
	}

	if (!subscriberView) {
		var subscriber = session.subscribe(stream);
		subscriberView = subscriber.createView({
			width : '400px',
			height : '300px',
			left : 0,
			bottom: 0
		});
		if (subscriberView) $.videoView.add(subscriberView);
		if (Alloy.CFG.Android) {
			session.connectSubscriber();
		}
	}
}
